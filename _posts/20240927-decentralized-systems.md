Over the past year, I have developed a keen interest in decentralized systems, as I believe that modern systems are predominantly built on centralized architectures, which directly jeopardize the control of data by individual users. I firmly believe that the control of user data must belong to the users themselves, an unshakable principle.

Consequently, I have a particular fascination with building decentralized systems, especially decentralized data systems. I eagerly anticipate the day when I have ample free time to engage in anonymous and profoundly meaningful open-source work, akin to Satoshi Nakamoto.
