title: "Aerobic Capacity Clustering"
excerpt: "This project is the subject of my internship as a machine learning engineer at the Southeast Digital Economic Development Institute (Quzhou). It aims to learn the human's aerobic capacity from the exercise data (e.g., heart rate and speed) of undergraduate students, and thus a customized exercise program can be provided for each student. This project is co-funded by the National Student Innovation Training Program and Zhejiang Province New Talent Program."
