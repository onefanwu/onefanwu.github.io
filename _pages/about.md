I am currently a PhD student at the Database and Data Intelligence Lab (DILAB) of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OlITuIAAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering in 2021 from Zhejiang University of Technology, where I was advised by Prof. [Lianghuai Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Yang-39) and Prof. [Yongliang Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599095900).

## Research

I am interested in database systems, decentralized systems, and hardware acceleration. My research interest is in inventing efficient query processing and storage optimization techniques for emerging hardware. Specifically, my current research focuses on accelerating emerging analytical queries (e.g., in-DB AI inference) using emerging hardware (e.g., Compute-in-Memory architecture) and modern hardware (e.g., GPU).

<!-- My current research is focused on [Array DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS) and Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architecture, especially on improving query execution performance on emerging hardware. -->
