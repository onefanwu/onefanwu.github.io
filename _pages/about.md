I am currently a PhD student at the [Database and Data Intelligence Lab](https://github.com/dilab-zju) of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OlITuIAAAAJ). I have a keen interest in database systems, data management, decentralized systems, and hardware acceleration. My research is dedicated to developing innovative techniques for efficient query processing and storage optimization, particularly in the context of emerging hardware. Currently, my focus is on leveraging cutting-edge compute-in-memory hardware and modern accelerators such as GPUs to expedite the execution of advanced analytical queries.

<!-- ## Research

I am interested in database systems, decentralized systems, and hardware acceleration. My research interest is in inventing efficient query processing and storage optimization techniques for emerging hardware. Specifically, my current research focuses on accelerating emerging analytical queries (e.g., in-DB AI inference) using emerging compute-in-memory hardware and modern hardware (e.g., GPU). -->

<!-- My current research is focused on [Array DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS) and Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architecture, especially on improving query execution performance on emerging hardware. -->
