I am currently a PhD student at [ZJU DILab](https://dilab-zju.github.io/) working with Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should). Before joining ZJU, I worked with Prof. [Lianghuai Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Yang-39) and Yongliang Zhang at ZJUT, where I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in software engineering. My research interests are in Database Systems, Data Management, Computing-in-Memory.
