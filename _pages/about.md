I am currently a PhD student at the [Database and Data Intelligence Lab](https://dilab-zju.github.io/) of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OlITuIAAAAJ). I also work closely with [Dawei Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2MvjeMAAAAJ) and [Ke Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cqfBLecAAAAJ). Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering in 2021 from Zhejiang University of Technology, where I was advised by Prof. [Lianghuai Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Yang-39) and Prof. [Yongliang Zhang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37599095900).

## Research

I am interested in database systems, data management, and emerging hardware. My current research interests are in query processing and storage optimization techniques for emerging hardware. Specifically, my research focuses on accelerating analytical processing (e.g., matrix computation and video analytics) using emerging hardware (e.g., Compute-in-Memory architecture) and modern hardware (e.g., CXL+SSD and CPU-GPU co-processing).

<!-- My current research is focused on [Array DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_DBMS) and Compute-in-Memory (CIM) architecture, especially on improving query execution performance on emerging hardware. -->
