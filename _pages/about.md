I am currently a PhD student at the State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OlITuIAAAAJ). I have a keen interest in Data Infrastructure, Databases, Data Market, Blockchain, and Emerging Hardware. 

My current research is anchored in two interesting areas. Specifically, I'm designing novel frameworks for serverless data warehouses to significantly optimize cloud resource management and integrate AI capabilities. Simultaneously, I'm actively exploring the use of emerging hardware technologies, such as compute-in-memory architectures, to aggressively accelerate analytical workloads.
