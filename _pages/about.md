I am currently a PhD student at the database and data intelligence lab (DILAB) of Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0OlITuIAAAAJ). I have a keen interest in database systems, data management, decentralized systems, and hardware acceleration. My research is dedicated to developing innovative techniques for efficient query processing and storage optimization, particularly in the context of emerging hardware. Currently, my focus is on leveraging cutting-edge compute-in-memory hardware and modern accelerators such as GPUs to expedite the execution of advanced analytical queries.
