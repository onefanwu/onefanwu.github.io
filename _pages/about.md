I am a first-year PhD student at [ZJU Database and Data Intelligence Lab](https://dilab-zju.github.io/) advised by Prof. [Lidan Shou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should). My research interests are in Database Systems, Data Management, In-Memory Computing.
Prior to ZJU, I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Lianghuai Yang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liang-Yang-39) and Yongliang Zhang at ZJUT, where I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in software engineering.
